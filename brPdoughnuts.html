                <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong><br><br><strong>Doughnuts</strong>
                    <li>1/2 cup (99g) vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>3 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 to 1 1/2 cups (198g to 298g) granulated sugar*</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups (340g) pumpkin purée</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice, or 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon plus heaping 1/4 teaspoon each nutmeg and ginger</li>
                    <li>1 1/3 to 1 1/2 cups (160g to 180g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                    <li>1 3/4 cups + 2 tablespoons (224g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
                    <li class="list-no">*Use the lower amount of sugar for a less sweet version; the doughnuts will be slightly less tender.</li><br>
                    <strong>Coating</strong>
                    <li>3 tablespoons (35g) cinnamon sugar</li>
                </ul>
                <ol><strong>Instructions</strong>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease two standard doughnut pans. If you don't have doughnut pans, you can bake these in a standard muffin tin; they just won't be doughnuts.</li>
                    <li>To make the batter: Beat together the oil, eggs, sugar, pumpkin, spices, salt, and baking powder until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Add the flour, stirring just until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Fill the wells of the doughnut pans about 3/4 full; use a scant 1/4 cup of batter in each well. If you're making muffins, fill each well about 3/4 full; the recipe makes about 15, so you'll need to bake in two batches (unless you have two muffin pans).</li>
                    <li>Bake the doughnuts for 15 to 18 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center of one comes out clean. If you're making muffins, they'll need to bake for 23 to 25 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove the doughnuts from the oven, and after about 5 minutes, loosen their edges, and transfer them to a rack to cool.</li>
                    <li>To coat: While the doughnuts are still warm (but no longer fragile), gently shake them in a bag with the cinnamon sugar. If you've made muffins, sprinkle their tops heavily with cinnamon sugar. Only coat the number of doughnuts that will be consumed that same day; otherwise, they'll get soggy.</li>
                    <li>Storage information: Cool completely, and store any untopped doughnuts at room temperature for several days. Don't wrap them tightly in plastic; store them on a plate covered with a cake cover; or in a plastic bag that's not fastened shut. Add cinnamon-sugar coating just before serving.</li>
                </ol>        
                <ul><strong>Tips from our Bakers</strong>
                    <li>Want to make these doughnuts with King Arthur Unbleached Self-Rising Flour? Reduce the salt to 1/2 teaspoon; omit the baking powder, and substitute 2 cups (8 ounces) self-rising flour for the all-purpose flour. Bake the doughnuts for about 18 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Want to make these gluten-free? For great results, substitute King Arthur Gluten-Free Measure for Measure Flour for the all-purpose flour in this recipe. Be sure to bake thoroughly; gluten-free baked goods often need a bit more time in the oven.</li>
                    <li>Can you make this batter into doughnut holes? Yes! Portion the batter into a lightly greased mini muffin pan or doughnut hole pan, filling the wells about 3/4 full; a teaspoon cookie scoop works well here. Bake in a preheated 425°F oven for 7 to 8 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of one of the doughnut holes comes out clean, or with a few moist crumbs. Remove from the oven, let the holes cool in the pan for about 5 minutes, then toss them in cinnamon-sugar. Repeat with the remaining batter. Yield: about 5 1/2 dozen doughnut holes.</li>
